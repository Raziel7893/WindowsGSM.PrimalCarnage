### Port Forwarding (YOU NEED THIS, TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT FROM THE INTERNET(only for servers/pcs at home):
- If You don't know How: Google: YourRouterBrand + Portforwarding
- 7777 UDP - Default
- 27015 TCP - default query port

### Files To Backup
- Save Gane (You could only save serverfiles/PrimalCarnage/Saved , but that includes many big logs)
  - WindowsGSM\servers\%ID%\serverfiles/PrimalCarnage/Saved/SaveGames
  - WindowsGSM\servers\%ID%\serverfiles/PrimalCarnage/Saved/Config/WindowsServer", backupName="PrimalCarnage/PrimalCarnage/Saved/Config/WindowsServer
- WindowsGSM Config
  - WindowsGSM\servers\%ID%\configs

### Available Params
All these params are automatically set by WGSM
- -NOSTEAM                      Suggested StartParameters from the default start script, not sure what it does, changes nothing, so it is skipped by default. Maybe there is an update on release for it (cann be added in Additional Parameters)
- -log                          creates logfiles in serverId\serverfiles\PrimalCarnage\Saved\Logs

### How can you play with your friends without port forwarding?

- After they've joined to your network
- They can connect using the IP you've created eg: 10.123.17.1:7777
